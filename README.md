# Sentiment Analysis
First 100 days: a comparison of Donald Trump and Joe Biden

This final project was an opportunity for me to explore a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning technique for sentiment analysis. This expanded on the introduction to NLP that we learned in class. Additional challenges were to create a Twitter Developer account and use the credentials to access the Twitter API in order to pull historical tweets via the Python Library "Tweepy". The cleaning, formatting and processing of the data challenged my Python (and many libraries) skills learned during the course. This included learning about and employing "TextBlob", the Python library to do sentiment analysis. Additionally, the final website was built using my recent experience with Bootstrap which required CSS customization to make it visually interesting and user friendly. The final product also required graphic manipulation in Photoshop. Lastly - I chose to deploy it as a Github page as we have done for other projects during class. Here, on GitHub, the data, notebooks and website files are shared in one place.
