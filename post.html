                    <p>In the United States of America, the first 100 days of a presidential term has symbolic
                        significance.
                        This is when a president's specific priorities are defined and parlayed. It is also considered
                        an early
                        indicator to measure their success.</p>
                    <p>The term was originally coined in 1933 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he passed 76 laws during
                        his first 100 days.
                        While comparing their accomplishments during this time is beyond the scope of this article, we will consider the
                        messaging of each
                        politician. We want to explore the tone of each politician during this important period, also
                        known as the "honeymoon"
                        period of a presidency.
                        To do this, we will take a look at the Tweets made during the first 100 days for each politician
                        to see how objective and postive each president
                        was and what messsages resonated with their followers.</p>
                    <p>With the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we will explore Twitter data using
                        textual
                        featurization, sentiment analysis and word cloud visualizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following work employs data from Kaggle, as well as data collected from Twitter using Tweepy.
                        Tweepy is a Python library that allows you to access the Twitter API with a Twitter Developer
                        account
                        and access credentials. The data for Donald Trump is a dataset shared on Kaggle and includes all
                        of his Tweets
                        prior to his account being frozen. The data for Joe Biden was accessed via the Twitter API. Data
                        were cleaned
                        and formatted for analysis using various Python libraries (detailed in Notebooks). Data and
                        Jupyter Notebooks used for
                        the analysis are accessible
                        via the Github link at the bottom of this page.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The main purpose of exploratory data analysis is to better understand the data, look for any
                        patterns,
                        find interesting relationships among the different variables and brainstorm questions about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data for each candidate was cleaned and analysed using Python and associated libraries in Jupyter
                        notebooks.
                        Tweets for the first 100 days were
                        queried for each candidate. January 20-April 30, 2017 for Donald Trump and January 20-April 30,
                        2021, for
                        Joe Biden.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a first step, we look at some statistics of the tweets for each politician. The data below are
                        snapshots
                        of the results of the Pandas built-in function df.describe() for the numerical fields in the
                        datasets.

                        first 100 days (520)
                        is significantly greater than that of Joe Biden (183).</blockquote>
                    <p>When users retweet a tweet they amplify the message of it. It can also help develop the
                        followers of the original tweeter. Let's review the top 10 most re-tweeted tweets for each.</p>

                    <p>Most of Biden's top retweets are focused on getting started in office and the inauguration. They also address
                        wearing masks and
                        rejoining the Paris Climate agreement.</p>

                    <p> Trump's most retweeted tweet was that peaceful protests are a hallmark of democracy. Interestingly,
                        his second most retweeted tweet was about the Patriots' comeback win.

                    <p>When users 'favorite' a tweet, they are showing appreciation for it. The more favorites a tweet
                        has, the more
                        we know it is adding value to social media content. Let's review the top 10 most favorited

                    <p>Biden's most retweeted tweet is also his most liked or favorited. His readers are most supportive of the tweet
                        "It's a new day in America".</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">TextBlob Sentiment Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Next, we processed the data further by utilizing TextBlob, a Python library that provides an API
                        for many common natural
                        language processing (NLP) tasks including sentiment analysis. </p>
                    <p>TextBlob’s sentiment analysis processing employs two key metrics:
                        polarity and subjectivity. The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0], and it
                        reflects the emotional charge of a
                        statement or passage. Subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0], where 0.0 is very
                        objective and 1.0 is very subjective.</p>
                    <p>The following are the polarity scores for each president based on their respecive tweets.</p>
                    <div class="zoom">
                    <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Polarity_hist.png" alt="..." /></a></div>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">(Hover over image to make larger)</span>
                    <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – -->
                    <!-- that’s what living is all about.</span> -->
                    <p> Looking at the polarity score, for the most part both candidates remained neutral on the
                        majority of their tweets. Trump's range is greater as he tweeted significantly more than Biden 
                        and he has more in the negative direction beyond that of Biden but he also has some that are more positive.</p>
                    <p>Another way to classify text is to determine the objectivity or subjectivity of it.
                        If text is objective, it is considered factual and not someone's personal opinion.
                        Subjective sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion, or judgment. </p>
                    <p>The following are the subjectivity scores for each president based on their respecive tweets.</p>

                    <p> As you can see in this histogram, Biden's tweets fall mostly below 0.6 and on the objective end
                        of the spectrum. Trump, on the other hand is across the board with a large portion centered
                        midway along
                        the continuum of objectivity/subjectivity with many more tweets considered subjective rather than factual and objective.</p>
                    <p>Let's inspect tweets by looking at them sorted by positive polarity and showing the top 5 rows.

                    <p>Biden's tweets have well wishes to the public for two holidays and he shares the good news around
                        vaccines. We see many positive words such as "wish", "health", "hope", "happiness" and "prosperity".</p>

                        of Honor Day. Trump uses positive words including "happy", "congratulations", "wonderful" and "welcome".</p>
                    <p>Let's take another look at them showing the top 5 most negatively charged tweets by politician.

                    <p>Biden's tweets reflect a tough time in America especially around race relations. His tweets
                        comment on Daunte Wright
                        and also the Derek Chauvin murder trial - the police officer found guilty of murdering George Floyd.
                        While
                        these messages are called out as negative, the sentiment is clearly positive from Joe Biden. Negative words
                        include "pain", "anger", "trauma", "murdering" and "guilty".
                    </p>

                    <p>Trump is concerned with FBI leaks and accuses former President Obama of wire tapping and McCarthyism. He promotes
                        fear-mongering by the statement "we must keep evil out of our country" and the idea that vicious
                        prisoners have been released by the Obama administration.</p>

                    <p>Biden's Tweets over time were pretty consistent and averaged almost 2 tweets per day. The first and last days
                        had significantly more tweets and this would make sense because it was inauguration day and the 100th day when he 
                        probably tweeted progress on his commitments for the first 100 days.</p>

                    <p>Trumps tweets varied across the time period and he averaged over 5 tweets per day. Based on the frequency, polarity and 
                        subjectivity of his tweets, its possible he tweets in a less informative and in a less official capacity.

                    <p> For the graphics below we categorized our polarity values into to sentiment classes (negative =
                        -1 to -0.01,
                        neutral = -0.01 to 0.01, and positive = 0.01 to 1). </p>

                    <p>More than half of Biden's tweets were positive and less than 15% were negative. More than half of
                        Trumps were also positive,
                        but the remaining were pretty evenly split between negative (almost 24%) and neutral.
                    </p>
                    <P>Plotly was used to create the graphs below. They show the average subjectivity and polarity scores for tweets aggregated by date for each
                        president.

                    <div class="zoom">

                    <p> I wouldn't say a trend exists necessarily over time for either president in polarity or subjectivity. However it is obvious 
                        that Biden appears more positive in his tweets overall when compared to Trump's and Trump has significantly more subjective 
                        tweets especially early in his 100 day 
                        period.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Word Cloud Visualizations</h2>
                    <p>Lastly, we take a look at the frequency of words tweeted by generating word clouds using the Python library "Word Cloud".

                    <p>The most frequently occuring words in Biden's tweets include "POTUS", "America(n)", "will", "rescue" and "WhiteHouse".</p>

                    <p>In Trump's cloud we see "great", "American", "will", "Fake news" and "Russia".</p>
                    <p>That concludes the exploration of tweet sentiments of each President's first 100 days. I won't comment
                        on which I felt was more postitive and subjective - you can draw your own conclusions on the data provided. <p>Please
